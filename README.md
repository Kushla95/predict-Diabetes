# What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and when it is not functioning properly, it can lead to a range of complications.

There are two main types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops in childhood, where the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is more common and typically develops in adults, where the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels.
